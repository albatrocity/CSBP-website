      Join us July 6th for the Crossroads Summer Block Party presented by [Golden Sound Records](https://goldensoundrecords.com)! Enjoy an evening of live music, food, and festivities to celebrate Kansas City's culture and its sweltering summers. We're kicking things off around 4PM on 19th street in the Crossroads Arts District (between Wyandotte and Baltimore). Spend the evening chowing down on local food truck cuisine, hanging with friends & neighbors, and taking in the sounds of some of KC's most dynamic local music.

      Bring your friends & family to the First Fridays event of 2012, preceding the big game hosted at Kauffman Stadium, and discover a taste of what makes Kansas City and the Crossroads Arts District one-of-a-kind.
